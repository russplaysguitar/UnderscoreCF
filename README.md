This project is designed to be an [UnderscoreJS](http://underscorejs.org/) port for Coldfusion. 

Read the official documentation here: [russplaysguitar.github.com/UnderscoreCF/](http://russplaysguitar.github.com/UnderscoreCF/)

Underscore.cfc is a utility-belt library that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you would expect in Prototype.js (or Ruby). It provides dozens of functions that support both the usual functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized helpers: function binding, sorting, deep equality testing, and so on. It delegates to built-in functions where applicable. 

Underscore.cfc is only compatible with Adobe Coldfusion 10.

Contributions are welcome.
